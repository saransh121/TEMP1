	•	Implement role-based access control for database and system users.

3. Functional Requirements

3.1. Spending Analysis

	•	Extract and categorize transaction data into high-spending categories.
	•	Generate insights such as total spend, frequency, and preferred merchants.

3.2. Customer Segmentation

	•	Cluster customers based on spending habits, location, and frequency.
	•	Generate recommendations for targeted marketing campaigns.

3.3. Dashboard and Reports

	•	Provide real-time visualizations using Tableau Server, Power BI Report Server, or Plotly/Dash.
	•	Include:
	•	Heatmaps for high-potential areas.
	•	Insights on top customers and spending trends.

3.4. Predictive Modeling

	•	Predict future spending trends and customer behavior.
	•	Identify customers likely to respond to campaigns or at risk of attrition.

4. Team Requirements
