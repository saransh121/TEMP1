Here’s a simplified version with all formulas written in plain text for easy copying:

1. LIFE_IN_PROCESSING_FEE_CHARGES

Logic:
	•	Fee is based on the loan amount and LI_TYPE (e.g., Monthly, Upfront).

Formula:
LIFE_IN_PROCESSING_FEE_CHARGES = Loan Amount × Monthly Fee Percentage

Example:
	•	Loan Amount: 100,000 OMR
	•	Monthly Fee Percentage: 0.5%
LIFE_IN_PROCESSING_FEE_CHARGES = 100,000 × 0.005 = 500 OMR per month

2. DISBURSED_LOAN_AMOUNT

Logic:
	•	Total amount disbursed after deducting fees.

Formula:
DISBURSED_LOAN_AMOUNT = Loan Amount - (Processing Fees + Life Insurance Fees + Other Fees)

Example:
	•	Loan Amount: 100,000 OMR
	•	Processing Fees: 500 OMR
	•	Life Insurance: 2,000 OMR
DISBURSED_LOAN_AMOUNT = 100,000 - (500 + 2,000) = 97,500 OMR

3. MAX_LOAN_TENOR

Logic:
	•	Maximum allowable loan tenor based on customer age.

Formula:
MAX_LOAN_TENOR = (MAX_AGE - Customer Age) × 12

Example:
	•	Customer Age: 45 years
	•	Maximum Age Allowed: 60 years
MAX_LOAN_TENOR = (60 - 45) × 12 = 180 months (15 years)

4. MAX LOAN AMOUNT

Logic:
	•	Maximum loan amount based on salary and DBR.

Formula:
MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT = (NET_SALARY × Salary Percentage) - Existing Loan EMI

Example:
	•	Net Salary: 1,500 OMR
	•	Salary Percentage: 50%
	•	Existing Loan EMI: 300 OMR
MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT = (1,500 × 0.5) - 300 = 450 OMR

5. EMI

Logic:
	•	EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is calculated using the standard EMI formula.

Formula:
EMI = (P × r × (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
Where:
P = Loan Amount
r = Monthly Interest Rate
n = Loan Tenor in months

Example:
	•	Loan Amount: 100,000 OMR
	•	Interest Rate: 6% annual (0.5% monthly)
	•	Loan Tenor: 120 months
EMI = (100,000 × 0.005 × (1 + 0.005)^120) / ((1 + 0.005)^120 - 1) = 1,110.21 OMR

6. DBR%

Logic:
	•	Represents total EMI as a percentage of salary.

Formula:
DBR% = (Total EMI (Existing + New) / Net Salary) × 100

Example:
	•	Net Salary: 1,500 OMR
	•	Existing EMI: 300 OMR
	•	New EMI: 800 OMR
DBR% = ((300 + 800) / 1,500) × 100 = 73.33%

7. Total_Property_Value%

Logic:
	•	Total property value for house loans.

Formula:
Total_Property_Value% = LAND_VALUE + BUILDING_VALUE

Example:
	•	Land Value: 50,000 OMR
	•	Building Value: 100,000 OMR
Total_Property_Value% = 50,000 + 100,000 = 150,000 OMR

8. Loan_Amount_Per_Property_Value%

Logic:
	•	Loan-to-value ratio for property loans.

Formula:
Loan_Amount_Per_Property_Value% = (Loan Amount / Total Property Value) × 100

Example:
	•	Loan Amount: 100,000 OMR
	•	Total Property Value: 150,000 OMR
Loan_Amount_Per_Property_Value% = (100,000 / 150,000) × 100 = 66.67%

9. Age Error

Logic:
	•	Triggers if age at maturity exceeds MAX_AGE.

Example:
	•	Current Age: 55 years
	•	Loan Tenor: 120 months
	•	Max Age: 60 years
Age Error = "Age at maturity exceeds maximum allowable age of 60 years."

10. LTV_Error

Logic:
	•	Checks if loan-to-value exceeds the maximum percentage.

Formula:
LTV% = (Loan Amount / Total Property Value) × 100

Example:
	•	Loan Amount: 100,000 OMR
	•	Total Property Value: 150,000 OMR
	•	Maximum LTV: 60%
LTV_Error = "LTV exceeds the allowable percentage of 60%."

11. Age At Maturity

Logic:
	•	Customer’s age at the end of the loan tenor.

Formula:
Age At Maturity = Current Age + (Loan Tenor (months) / 12)

Example:
	•	Current Age: 30 years
	•	Loan Tenor: 180 months
Age At Maturity = 30 + (180 / 12) = 45 years

12. Loan Processing FEE With VAT

Logic:
	•	Processing fee including VAT.

Formula:
Loan Processing FEE With VAT = Processing Fee + (Processing Fee × VAT Rate)

Example:
	•	Processing Fee: 1,000 OMR
	•	VAT Rate: 5%
Loan Processing FEE With VAT = 1,000 + (1,000 × 0.05) = 1,050 OMR

13. EMI START DATE and EMI END DATE

Logic:
	•	Dates fetched from the amortization schedule.

Example:
	•	Loan Start Date: 1st Jan 2024
	•	Loan Tenor: 120 months
EMI Start Date = 1st Feb 2024
EMI End Date = 1st Jan 2034
