Working Mechanism

	1.	Parameter Validation:
	•	Validates key parameters like DATE_OF_BIRTH, NET_SALARY, and REQUESTED_LOAN_TENOR to ensure the customer meets the loan eligibility criteria.
	2.	Loan Tenor and Age Checks:
	•	Uses the EMI_CONDITIONS table to determine:
	•	Maximum loan tenor (MAX_LOAN_TENOR).
	•	Minimum and maximum age (minAge and MAX_AGE).
	•	Calculates the customer’s age in months and checks if the loan tenor exceeds the maximum permissible age.
	3.	Interest Serving Period:
	•	If INTEREST_SERVING_PERIOD is provided, adjusts the loan tenor to account for the period during which only interest is served.
	4.	Eligibility Calculations:
	•	Calculates the maximum loan amount based on the customer’s salary, product type, and other parameters.
	•	Ensures that the loan amount requested does not exceed eligibility (maxLoanAmountPerProperty for property loans).
	5.	Fee Calculations:
	•	Calculates various fees based on the product and loan type:
	•	Processing fee.
	•	Life insurance fee (LIFE_INSURANCE).
	•	Property-related fees (e.g., mortgage fee, valuation fee).
	•	Applies VAT where applicable.
	6.	Loan Disbursement:
	•	Determines the disbursed loan amount by summing all applicable fees and the loan principal.
	•	Adjusts the loan amount if the customer qualifies for exceptions or waivers.
	7.	EMI and Amortization Schedule:
	•	Calculates the EMI using the loan tenor and interest rate.
	•	Calls SP_BUILD_LOAN_AMORTIZATION to generate the amortization schedule.
	8.	Error Handling:
	•	Validates all calculations and returns errors if:
	•	Loan tenor exceeds the permissible age.
	•	Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is not met.
	•	DBR (Debt-to-Burden Ratio) exceeds the limit.
	9.	Result Compilation:
	•	Inserts all calculated values and error messages into a temporary table (EMI_TEMP).
	•	Returns the data via the output cursor RESULT.
