Logic and Uses of LI_TYPE

The parameter LI_TYPE determines how life insurance is calculated and applied in the loan process. Below are the details:

Values of LI_TYPE

	1.	Monthly: Life insurance is calculated and charged monthly.
	2.	Upfront: Life insurance is charged for the entire loan tenor upfront.
	3.	Outside Cover: No insurance fee is charged; customer provides external insurance.
	4.	Customer Provided: Similar to “Outside Cover”; customer has their own insurance.
	5.	Aman: Special type of insurance with custom calculations.
	6.	Aman Plus: Enhanced version of “Aman” with higher premium rates.

Logic

	1.	If LI_TYPE = Monthly:
	•	Formula:
LIFE_INSURANCE = (Loan Amount / 1,000) × Monthly Rate × Loan Tenor
	•	Example:
Loan Amount = 100,000 OMR
Monthly Rate = 0.5 OMR per 1,000 OMR
Loan Tenor = 120 months
Calculation:
LIFE_INSURANCE = (100,000 / 1,000) × 0.5 × 120 = 6,000 OMR
	2.	If LI_TYPE = Upfront:
	•	Formula:
LIFE_INSURANCE = (Loan Amount / 1,000) × Annual Rate × Loan Tenor in Years
	•	Example:
Loan Amount = 100,000 OMR
Annual Rate = 2 OMR per 1,000 OMR
Loan Tenor = 10 years
Calculation:
LIFE_INSURANCE = (100,000 / 1,000) × 2 × 10 = 2,000 OMR
	3.	If LI_TYPE = Outside Cover or Customer Provided:
	•	Formula:
LIFE_INSURANCE = 0
	4.	If LI_TYPE = Aman:
	•	Formula:
LIFE_INSURANCE = Loan Amount × 0.2% × Loan Tenor in Years
	•	Example:
Loan Amount = 100,000 OMR
Loan Tenor = 10 years
Calculation:
LIFE_INSURANCE = 100,000 × 0.002 × 10 = 2,000 OMR
	5.	If LI_TYPE = Aman Plus:
	•	Formula:
LIFE_INSURANCE = Loan Amount × 0.25% × Loan Tenor in Years
	•	Example:
Loan Amount = 100,000 OMR
Loan Tenor = 10 years
Calculation:
LIFE_INSURANCE = 100,000 × 0.0025 × 10 = 2,500 OMR

Uses of LI_TYPE

	1.	Risk Coverage: Ensures the loan is insured against unforeseen borrower risks.
	2.	Loan Disbursement Amount: Determines whether insurance fees are deducted upfront or charged monthly.
	3.	Loan Eligibility: Life insurance may be mandatory for some loans.
	4.	Customer Flexibility: Allows customers to use external insurance.
	5.	Bank’s Profitability: Generates additional revenue through insurance fees.

Practical Examples

Case 1: Monthly Insurance

	•	Loan Amount = 50,000 OMR
	•	Monthly Rate = 0.5 OMR per 1,000 OMR
	•	Loan Tenor = 60 months
	•	Calculation:
LIFE_INSURANCE = (50,000 / 1,000) × 0.5 × 60 = 1,500 OMR

Case 2: Upfront Insurance

	•	Loan Amount = 80,000 OMR
	•	Annual Rate = 2 OMR per 1,000 OMR
	•	Loan Tenor = 10 years
	•	Calculation:
LIFE_INSURANCE = (80,000 / 1,000) × 2 × 10 = 1,600 OMR

Case 3: Outside Cover

	•	Life insurance fee is not applied.
	•	LIFE_INSURANCE = 0
