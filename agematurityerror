Here’s the logic for Age At Maturity Error in plain text format for easy copying:

Logic for Age At Maturity Error

The Age At Maturity Error occurs when the borrower’s age at the end of the loan tenor exceeds the maximum allowable age (MAX_AGE). This ensures the customer can repay the loan within an acceptable timeframe.

1. Age at Maturity Calculation

The customer’s age at loan maturity is calculated as:

Age At Maturity = Current Age + (Loan Tenor (in months) / 12)

Where:
	•	Current Age = AGE_IN_MONTHS / 12
	•	Loan Tenor is the requested duration of the loan.

2. Condition Check

If:

Age At Maturity > MAX_AGE

Then an error is triggered:

Age At Maturity Error = "Your requested loan tenor exceeds max allowable age. Max age is: " + MAX_AGE + " years."

3. Adjustments with Waiver Period

If a waiver period is included in the loan (e.g., delayed repayments), the loan tenor is adjusted:

Adjusted Loan Tenor = Loan Tenor + Waiver Months

This increases the risk of exceeding MAX_AGE.

Practical Examples

Example 1: No Waiver

	•	Customer Age: 40 years
	•	Loan Tenor: 240 months (20 years)
	•	Maximum Age (MAX_AGE): 60 years

Calculation:

Age At Maturity = 40 + (240 / 12) = 40 + 20 = 60 years

Condition:

Age At Maturity <= MAX_AGE

Result: No error; loan is approved.

Example 2: Exceeds MAX_AGE

	•	Customer Age: 50 years
	•	Loan Tenor: 180 months (15 years)
	•	Maximum Age (MAX_AGE): 60 years

Calculation:

Age At Maturity = 50 + (180 / 12) = 50 + 15 = 65 years

Condition:

Age At Maturity > MAX_AGE

Result:

Age At Maturity Error = "Your requested loan tenor exceeds max allowable age. Max age is: 60 years."

Example 3: With Waiver Period

	•	Customer Age: 45 years
	•	Loan Tenor: 120 months (10 years)
	•	Waiver Period: 12 months
	•	Maximum Age (MAX_AGE): 55 years

Calculation:

Adjusted Loan Tenor = 120 + 12 = 132 months
Age At Maturity = 45 + (132 / 12) = 45 + 11 = 56 years

Condition:

Age At Maturity > MAX_AGE

Result:

Age At Maturity Error = "Your requested loan tenor and waiver period exceed max allowable age. Max age is: 55 years."

4. Loan Tenor Adjustment

If the requested tenor exceeds the allowable limit, the system can suggest a revised tenor:

Max Loan Tenor Allowed = (MAX_AGE - Current Age) × 12

Example:
	•	Customer Age: 50 years
	•	Maximum Age (MAX_AGE): 60 years

Max Loan Tenor Allowed = (60 - 50) × 12 = 120 months (10 years)

Suggestion:

"Please reduce the loan tenor to 120 months to meet max allowable age."

Error Messages

	1.	Without Waiver:

"Your requested loan tenor exceeds max allowable age. Max age is: 60 years."


	2.	With Waiver:

"Your requested loan tenor and waiver period exceed max allowable age. Max age is: 55 years."


	3.	Suggested Adjustment:

"Please reduce the loan tenor to 120 months to meet max allowable age."
